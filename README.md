# **Carbon Detector Projector**

Welcome to the Carbon Detector Projector! This tool is designed to help you identify and quantify carbon emissions from satellite imagery.

## **How it works**

The Carbon Detector Projector works by analyzing images of the Earth's surface and identifying pixels that correspond to carbon plumes. The intensity of the carbon plumes is then quantified based on the number of pixels of each color (red, green, blue, yellow) present in the image.

To use the Carbon Detector Projector, simply provide an image as input and the projector will return an output image highlighting the carbon plumes and the corresponding carbon intensity values.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the process:

1. The input image is passed through a series of filters to separate the pixels corresponding to carbon plumes from the rest of the image.
2. The intensity of the carbon plumes is then calculated based on the number of pixels of each color present in the image.
3. The output image is generated by overlaying the carbon plume pixels on the original image, with the intensity of the carbon plumes represented by the transparency of the overlaid pixels.
4. The carbon intensity values are returned along with the output image.

## **Using the Carbon Detector Projector**

To use the Carbon Detector Projector, simply provide an image as input and the projector will return an output image highlighting the carbon plumes and the corresponding carbon intensity values.
